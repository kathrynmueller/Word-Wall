Word Wall is a web application for word nerds! A user enters a word; the app returns the first definition from the Oxford English Dictionary and then adds that word to the user's Word Wall. The wall continues to grow, though a user can delete words they wish they'd never searched... 

Word Wall integrates the [Oxford English Dictionary's API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/) to return definitions.
